#3D-Printer:
  - This project is for slicer software design of 3D-printer. 
  - The main purpose is to convert .stl file to Gcode which can be read by CNC machine (i.e. the 3D-printer in our project).
  - The highlight is the procesdure of converting is fast. And the Gcode indicates a better path for CNC machine drawing.
